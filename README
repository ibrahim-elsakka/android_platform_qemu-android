This directory is now empty!

The external/qemu-android sources have been merged into
the external/qemu directory. This makes development of
the Android Emulator simpler for everyone.

The merge happened on commit in external/qemu:

    6e52eee Merge external/qemu-android into external/qemu

And used the following parent commit from external/qemu-android:

    55ae224 Merge "Limit the max number of thread pool threads in 32-bit Windows" into emu-master-dev

If you have a pending patch on top of the old directory structure,
you will have to transfer it to external/qemu using the following
procedure:

  BRANCH=<your-branch-name>
  BASE=55ae224
  cd external/qemu
  git checkout $BRANCH
  git format-patch -k -o /tmp/qemu-patches-$BRANCH $BASE..HEAD
  cd ../qemu
  repo start $BRANCH .
  git am /tmp/qemu-patches-$BRANCH/*
  rm -rf /tmp/qemu-patches-$BRANCH
